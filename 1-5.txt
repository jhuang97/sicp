(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
	(if (= x 0)
		0
		y))

Then evaluate
(test 0 (p))

applicative-order evaluation gives
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
(test 0 (p))
...
We'll be stuck evaluating (p) forever? I tried doing this in Scheme and this line indeed never finished evaluating.

normal-order evaluation
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
0
