The good-enough? test fails for large and small inputs.
Small: (sqrt .0001) isn't accurate.
Big: (sqrt 1e46) does not return.  Presumably floating-point arithmetic means that there is not enough precision in calculating guess and the square of guess to be within the desired tolerance of 1e46.

(define (good-enough2? guess x)
	(< (abs (/ (- (square guess) x) x)) 0.001))

Yup, it's better now.
